		 Goats are a mess. Do you know what's also a mess? You and your house. But don't worry, goats can eat up that mess in less than a minute. They'll eat your trash, your clothes, your children, your food, or any unwanted thing you leave lying around your house. You don't only not have to feed it, it will feed you! with its goat milk and goat cheese. All YOU have to do is extract it! Yep, goats are great. They're great pets too if you're ever lonely and need something to love or need an evil companion to dominate the world with. Goats are the most advanced technology you could ever own, and they have evolved greatly over the years. So go into the wild, find a goat, tame it, dress it up, get it checked for deadly diseases, and take it home. Once you have completed your goat journey, you will be rewarded, with a perfect pet thing, a perfect friend/partner, and endless goat puns... GOAT GOAT GOATS!</P>
